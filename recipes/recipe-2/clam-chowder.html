    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This delicious clam chowder is cream-based and calls for the traditional chowder ingredients: onion, celery, potatoes, diced carrots,<br>cream, and clams. A little red wine vinegar is added before serving for extra flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups cubed potatoes</li>
      <li>1 cup diced carrots</li>
      <li>1 cup diced celery</li>
      <li>1 cup minced onion</li>
      <li>3 (6.5 ounce) cans minced clams, drained with juice reserved</li>
      <li>Water to cover</li>
      <li>3/4 cup butter</li>
      <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 quart half-and-half cream</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place potatoes, carrots, celery, and onion into a large skillet; pour in clam juice and add enough water to cover. Cook and stir<br>over medium-low heat until vegetables are tender.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour until smooth. Whisk in cream and stir<br>constantly until thick and smooth. Stir in vegetable mixture with any juices until just heated through.</li>
      <li>Stir in clams just before serving. If they cook too much they get tough. When clams are heated through, stir in vinegar and<br>season with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
