# odin-recipes

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a basic recipe website to demonstrate and practice my web development skills. The website currently only uses HTML/CSS as that is all I have learned so far. By the end of this project Javascript will be implemented.

## Progress
All of the progress I have made over time will be recorded here. This will act as a timeline and summarize the major changes and new implementations made in order to improve the look and functionality of this website.

### Initial implementation (Nov 13, 2024)
I created the initial website using only HTML. The home page consists of a list of links that includes four different recipes. Every recipe has its own page with an image, description, ingredients list, and directions all written in HTML.

### Update 1 (Dec 14, 2024)
These changes make the website look a little more alive and less like a word document.
- Added Arial font across the entire site.
- Created a navbar with a home and about page.
- Created an about page.
- Made the home page have basic recipe cards instead of a text list with recipe names.
- Fixed the oversized images on each recipe page.
